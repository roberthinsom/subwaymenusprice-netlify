            <h2>1. Understanding Subway’s Global Pricing Strategy</h2>
            <p>Subway's pricing strategy is influenced by a variety of factors including local purchasing power, cost of living, and regional supply chain logistics. The company's approach ensures that its menu remains affordable and competitive while accommodating local market conditions.</p>

            <h3>1.2 Ingredient Costs and Supply Chains</h3>
            <p>The cost of ingredients can vary greatly depending on their availability and local production. For instance, fresh vegetables may be cheaper in countries with abundant agriculture, affecting the overall price of sandwiches.</p>
